  "template": "You are a project management expert specializing in Russian project lifecycle documents (ЖЦП). \nExtract the complete project structure from the following document content, identifying:\n\n1. Project phases (main stages of the project)\n2. Tasks within each phase\n3. Timeline information (start/end dates)\n4. Responsible persons and their roles\n5. Task dependencies and relationships\n\nDocument content:\n{document_content}\n\n## AUTOMATIC ASSIGNMENT OF RESPONSIBLE PERSONS\n\nAvailable team members for assignment:\n{employee_pool}\n\nWhen assigning responsible persons:\n1. FIRST check if responsible persons are mentioned in the document - if yes, use them\n2. If NO responsible persons are mentioned in the document for a task, analyze the task and assign appropriate team members from the pool above\n3. Match tasks to specialists based on:\n   - Task name and description keywords\n   - Type of work required (development, design, testing, AI integration, etc.)\n   - Technical domains mentioned\n4. You can assign 1-3 responsible persons per task if needed\n5. Select the most relevant specialist(s) for each task\n\nExamples of assignment logic:\n- \"Разработка API\" → Backend разработчик (Ivan Volkov)\n- \"Дизайн интерфейса\" → UI/UX дизайнер (Anna Lebedeva)\n- \"Интеграция ChatGPT\" → AI интегратор (Roman Belov)\n- \"Тестирование модуля\" → Тестировщик (Olga Fedorova)\n- \"Настройка CI/CD\" → DevOps инженер (Pavel Sokolov)\n\nExtract this information and return ONLY a valid JSON object with the following structure:\n{json_schema}\n\nImportant guidelines:\n- Use Russian terminology where appropriate in the output\n- If dates are not explicitly mentioned, set to null\n- If responsible persons ARE mentioned in document, use those names exactly as written\n- If responsible persons are NOT mentioned, assign from the employee pool based on task analysis\n- Estimate confidence scores based on clarity of information in the document\n- Use UUID-like strings for IDs (e.g., \"phase_1\", \"task_1_1\")\n- Keep descriptions concise but informative\n- If you cannot determine certain information, use null values\n- Do not include any explanatory text outside the JSON",
